Description: An implementation for association analysis with CNV data in R. It
    provides two methods for association study: first, the observed probe
    intensity measurement can be directly used to detect the association of CNV
    with phenotypes of interest. Second, the most probable copy number is
    estimated with the proposed likelihood and the association of the most
    probable copy number with phenotype is tested. This method can be applied
    to both the independent and correlated population.
